When working with pg_vector, very soon it's nessesery to create index.

IVFFlat vs HNSW

1. IVFFlat (Inverted File Flat) - Suitable for larger datasets but may compromise on precision.
2. HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) - Provides better accuracy and efficiency but may require more memory.

Example of Index Creation

Let’s walk through the process of setting up and utilizing HNSW index.

## Step 1: Setting Up Sample Data

Start Postgres with pg_vector in docker container:

```sh
docker run -d --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg17
```

First, create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE postgres (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    vector VECTOR(5)
);
```

And insert some sample data - ie 1000 rows

```SQL
DO $$
DECLARE
    dessert_names TEXT[] := ARRAY[
        'Tiramisu', 'Crème Brûlée', 'Chocolate Mousse', 'Cheesecake',
        'Panna Cotta', 'Lemon Tart', 'Profiteroles', 'Éclairs',
        'Macarons', 'Crêpes Suzette'
    ];
    i INT;
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1..1000 LOOP
        INSERT INTO postgres (name, vector)
        VALUES (
            dessert_names[(random() * array_length(dessert_names, 1) + 1)::INT],
            ARRAY[
                round((random() * 1.2)::numeric, 1),
                round((random() * 1.2)::numeric, 1),
                round((random() * 1.2)::numeric, 1),
                round((random() * 1.2)::numeric, 1),
                round((random() * 1.2)::numeric, 1)
            ]::vector
        );
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

## Step 2: Sequential Scan Without Index

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, name, vector <=> '[0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1]' AS cosine_distance
FROM postres
ORDER BY vector <=> '[0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1]'
LIMIT 3;
```


```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY description_vector <-> '[0.2, 0.3, 0.4]' LIMIT 1;
```

As you can see, this approach requires scanning all rows in the table which can be inefficient as the dataset grows.:

Step 3: Creating an Index

Now let’s add an index to improve query performance:

HNSW Index Creation:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON postgres USING hnsw (vector vector_cosine_ops);
```

Step 4: Query Performance With Index

After creating the index, vacuum analyze the table to update the statistics:

```sql
VACUUM ANALYZE postres;
```

Now run the same query again:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, name, vector <=> '[0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1]' AS cosine_distance
FROM postres
ORDER BY vector <=> '[0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1]'
LIMIT 3;
```

As per docs, in order to use index, we need to (combine ORDER_BY and LIMIT)[https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#querying]:

We can see that the index is used:

Conclusion

Indexes play a crucial role in enhancing query performance for large datasets in pg_vector-powered databases. By understanding how to create and use different types of indexes such as IVFFlat and HNSW, you can optimize your queries efficiently.

Experiment with both types of indexes based on your dataset size and precision requirements to find what works best for your application needs.

In the next part, we will look at how to execute it on production.
